## Todo Application

This is my main project written in Java, Spring and React, the development of which I anticipate in the coming weeks
depending on time availability. Ultimately, the program is to be a fully web-based task management application. In the
first phase of development, I am going to focus on providing REST API and implementing most of the basic
functionalities. Then the program, following the MVC pattern, will be extended with the frontend part.

#### The application will include operations such as:

- adding, viewing, editing and closing tasks
- login, registration, editing profiles, administrator and user accounts
- assigning categories and creating your own
- searching, sorting and filtering of tasks
- creating groups, sharing tasks, assigning tasks to specyfic user
- viewing the schedule of tasks
